WEBDAV Testing 
Tools Used:
  NMAP - Used for port enumeration and scanning
  CADAVER - Used to exploit the webdav upload function vulnerability 
  DAVTEST - Testing for uploading diff file extensions and checking which one can be executed
This vulnerability is very interesting. The WebDav does not allow to upload or rename files with the extension .asp.
But you can bypass this adding at the end of the name ";.txt" and the file will be executed
as if it were a .asp file (you could also use ".html" instead of ".txt" but DON'T forget the ";").
Then you can upload your shell as a ".txt" file and copy/move it to a ".asp;.txt" file. 
An accessing that file through the web server, it will be executed (cadaver will said that the move action didn't work, but it did).

STEPS:
1 NMAP Enumeration :
     nmap -sV -sC $IP -vvvv
        sV - Service Version Detection for different services running on the IP
        sC - Default Nmap script to check the scripts
        vvvv - verbose level
2 nmap --script=http-enum $IP
here FOUND /webdav 
Authentication password is already given = bob:password_123321
2:DAVTEST
used davtest to find what are the extensions have execute functions
      davtest -url http://$IP/webdav
          here i found the .asp have execute rights
3. CADAVER - Used to exploit the upload function .asp
      cadaver $IP/webdav
when i reload the website http://$IP/webdav i have the .asp extension from there i gained the windows
