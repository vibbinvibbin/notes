what happens when we make a dns request

When you make a DNS (Domain Name System) request, you are asking a DNS resolver to translate a human-readable domain name (such as www.example.com) into an IP address that computers can understand. Here's an overview of what happens during a DNS request:

Request initiation: You start by entering a domain name into a web browser or any other network-enabled application on your device.

Local DNS cache check: Your device checks its local DNS cache to see if it has a record of the domain name and its corresponding IP address. This cache stores recent DNS lookups to speed up subsequent requests. If there is a match, the IP address is retrieved from the cache, and the process stops here.

Recursive DNS resolver: If the local DNS cache doesn't contain the requested domain, your device sends the DNS request to a recursive DNS resolver (usually provided by your ISP or a third-party DNS resolver). The resolver is responsible for handling the DNS request on your behalf.

Root DNS server: If the recursive DNS resolver doesn't have the IP address for the requested domain in its cache, it starts the resolution process by querying the root DNS server. The root DNS server is the starting point of the DNS hierarchy and holds information about the top-level domains (TLDs), such as .com, .org, .net.

TLD DNS server: The root DNS server responds to the recursive resolver with the IP address of the TLD DNS server responsible for the requested domain extension. For example, if you requested www.example.com, the root server would provide the IP address of the .com TLD DNS server.

Authoritative DNS server: The recursive resolver then contacts the TLD DNS server, which responds with the IP address of the authoritative DNS server for the specific domain (example.com). The authoritative DNS server is responsible for storing the DNS records for the domain.

DNS record retrieval: Finally, the recursive resolver contacts the authoritative DNS server and requests the IP address for the original domain name. The authoritative DNS server responds with the IP address, and the recursive resolver caches this information for future use.

Response to the client: The recursive resolver sends the IP address back to your device, which can now establish a connection to the desired web server using the IP address obtained.

Caching: Your device and the recursive resolver cache the DNS response to speed up future requests and reduce the load on the DNS infrastructure.

Once your device has the IP address, it can establish a connection with the server hosting the requested website and retrieve the web page content.

It's important to note that DNS requests typically happen behind the scenes and occur very quickly, so most users are unaware of this process unless there is a DNS-related issue or a need to troubleshoot network connectivity problems.
